1:
	Of course, we can do this with out-put restricted deque.
	Just reverse version of the description in this question.

2:
	order 325641:
	1 in, 2 in, 3 in, 3 out, 2 out, 4 in, 5 in, 5 out, 6 in, 6 out, 4 out, 1 out
	order 154623:
	this is impossible, because thie order of 2 and 3.

3:
	If there are infinite cars which can be in, then S always is admissible.
	And for X, if the number of S is larger than X's in stack, then X is admissible.
	Otherwise, X is inadmissible.

4:
	

5:
	This is simple to implement. pi in, pj in, pj out, pk in, pk out, pi out.

6:
	just 1 2 ... n. No any kind of changes.

7:
	a: 4213
	b: 4132
	c: 4231

8:
	i<j<k<l; pl<pj<pk<pi

9:
	Same with question 1

10:
	If there are infinite cars which can be in, then S,Q always is admissible.
        And for X, if the number of S & Q is larger than X's in stack, then X is admissible.
        Otherwise, X is inadmissible.

14:
	one stack just IN, another just OUT.
